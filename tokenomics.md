# Vault Protocol Tokenomics Strategy

The Vault Protocol tokenomics strategy aims to create a sustainable, user-centric ecosystem that incentivizes adoption, ensures long-term viability, and provides value to all stakeholders. By implementing a balanced token distribution, multi-faceted utility, and deflationary mechanisms, the VAULT token is designed to appreciate in value as the protocol grows. The strategy focuses on user acquisition and retention through airdrops and rewards, while also establishing multiple revenue streams to support ongoing development and maintenance. With a clear governance structure and a path to decentralization, the Vault Protocol is positioned to become a cornerstone of the digital asset management landscape in the Web3 space.

### 1. Token Utility

- **Vaulting and Locking Fee**: 1 VAULT token per MFA option used - with dynamic pricing adjustments based on regular DAO votes or the integration of a price-feed oracle to account for market conditions
- **Governance**: VAULT tokens grant voting rights on protocol upgrades and parameter changes
- **Staking**: Users can stake VAULT tokens to earn rewards and boost their benefits

## 2. Token Distribution

- Initial Supply: 1,000,000,000 (1 Billion) VAULT tokens
- Distribution:
  - 40% - User Signups and Growth Pool
  - 20% - Team and Advisors (vested over 4 years)
  - 15% - Treasury
  - 15% - Ecosystem Development Fund
  - 10% - Initial Liquidity Provision

## 3. User Acquisition and Retention

- Signup Airdrop: 100 VAULT tokens per new user (protected to be sybil-resistant via measures such as Gitcoin Passport, etc.)
- Referral Program: 50 VAULT tokens for both referrer and referee
- Usage Rewards: Tiered rewards based on the value and duration of assets vaulted or locked

## 4. Tokenomics Mechanics

### 4.1 Deflationary Mechanism
- Burn 50% of VAULT tokens collected as fees
- Remaining 50% distributed to stakers and treasury

### 4.2 Staking Rewards
- Annual Percentage Yield (APY) for staking: 5-15% (adjustable based on protocol health)
- Boosted rewards for longer staking periods

### 4.3 Governance Power
- 1 VAULT token = 1 vote
- Quadratic voting to prevent whale dominance

## 5. Revenue Streams

- Transaction Fees: 1 VAULT Token per MFA Factor used when vaulting/locking
- Premium Features: Support, API access, and white-label solutions for institutions

## 6. Token Unlock Schedule

- Team and Advisor tokens: 25% unlocked after 1 year, then linear vesting over 3 years
- Ecosystem Development Fund: 10% unlocked initially, then linear vesting over 5 years

## 7. Protocol Sustainability

- Treasury Management: Diversify holdings to ensure long-term sustainability
- Buyback and Burn: Use a portion of protocol revenue to buy back and burn VAULT tokens

## 8. Partnerships and Integrations

- Allocate tokens from Ecosystem Development Fund to incentivize mirrored asset integrations with other DeFi protocols
- Offer VAULT tokens as liquidity mining rewards on major DEXes

## 9. Security and Risk Management

- Insurance Fund: Allocate 5% of transaction fees to an insurance fund to cover potential smart contract vulnerabilities
- Regular audits and bug bounty programs funded by the treasury

## 10. Long-term Vision

- Cross-chain Expansion: Incentivize adoption on multiple blockchains using the Ecosystem Development Fund
- DAO Transition: Gradually transition protocol governance to a fully decentralized autonomous organization (DAO)
